                        "Oculi 1 began with my heartfelt conversations with individuals who have motor impairments over two years ago. With the advent of Apple Vision Pro and ongoing dialogues with the disability community, the spark for Oculi 2 was ignited. This new version introduces hand-tracking technology, enabling users to interact with their devices from afar â€“ eliminating the need to physically move or get up. No remote needed.\n\nOculi 2 is more than an accessibility tool; it's a commitment to making technology inclusive and empowering for everyone."
